# Implementation strategy — the decision

**Phase 3, document 5.** How Ehlnofey is actually built. This is the decision CLAUDE.md has carried as
open since Phase 0, and it gates Phase 4.

Read `tiers.md`, `difficulty-map.md` and `loot-model.md` first — this document costs out what they
specify and does not re-argue any of it.

---

## 1. The verdict

**A hybrid, split by *what kind of thing* is being edited rather than by convenience:**

> **Places and constants go in the plugin. Actors go in rules.**
>
> `Ehlnofey.esp` — **~376 override records**: the 355 encounter-zone bands, 3 game settings, 12
> globals, 5 capstone bosses and 1 vanilla bug fix. No new records, therefore **no FormIDs
> consumed**, therefore ESL-flaggable.
>
> **SkyPatcher INI rules** — the ~454 `PcLevelMult` actors and the ambient leveled lists: work that is
> filter-shaped, open-ended, and expensive to express as overrides.

This is a **revision of the working recommendation** in CLAUDE.md, which had rules doing "the broad
per-NPC/per-list/per-zone distribution" with the plugin reduced to "the handful of things rules cannot
reach". Phase 3 moved the zone work across the line, and §3 explains why.

Option A (plugin overrides for everything) and option B (rules for everything) are both rejected, in
§4 and §5.

---

## 2. The plugin — every record, enumerated

`Ehlnofey.esp`. Masters: `Skyrim.esm`, `Update.esm`, `Dawnguard.esm`, `Dragonborn.esm`
(`difficulty-map.md` scope decision). **ESL-flagged** — see §2.5.

### 2.1 Encounter zones — 355 records

The whole of `difficulty-map.md` §7. Two fields per record:

```yaml
MinLevel: 21
MaxLevel: 21
```

Preserve `Flags` exactly — 91 carry `NeverResets`, one `DisableCombatBoundary`. Clear
`MatchPcBelowMinimumLevel` on `WinterholdCollegeMiddenZone` (`10D415`), the only vanilla zone that
sets it (`engine-behaviour.md` §2).

### 2.2 Game settings — 3 records

Overrides of existing records; SkyPatcher has **no GMST module** (`skypatcher.md` §5.1), so these can
only be a plugin.

| GMST | FormKey | Vanilla | Ehlnofey | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fLeveledActorMultEasy` | `01A1D9:Skyrim.esm` | 0.33 | **0.70** | `tiers.md` §4 |
| `fLeveledActorMultMedium` | `01A1DB:Skyrim.esm` | 0.67 | **0.85** | `tiers.md` §4 |
| `fSpecialLootMinPCLevelMult` | `10FEDE:Skyrim.esm` | 0.6 | **0** | `loot-model.md` §4 |

`fLeveledActorMultHard` and `…VeryHard` keep their vanilla 1.0 / 1.25 and therefore need **no record**
— the deliberate consequence of `tiers.md` §4's decision to hold Hard at 1.0.

### 2.3 Globals — 12 records

The `LevelGate*` set, each set to **1** (`tiers.md` §8). Also plugin-only: SkyPatcher has no `global`
module — the 28 supported types (`skypatcher.md` §2) do not include it.

`LevelGateSpriggan` · `IceWraith` · `Bear` · `TrollCave` · `Wisp` · `WispMother` · `BearCave` ·
`TrollFrost` · `BearSnow` · `Falmer` · `Hagraven` · `Giant`.

### 2.4 Named records — 6

| Record | FormKey | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AlduinBase` | `08E4F1:Skyrim.esm` | `PcLevelMult` ×1.2 [10–100] → **fixed 60** | `tiers.md` §8 |
| `DLC1Harkon` | `003BA7:Dawnguard.esm` | ×1.2 [10–60] → **fixed 55** | must clear his own court (48/53) |
| `DLC1HarkonCombat` | `01A93D:Dawnguard.esm` | ×1.4 [10–60] → **fixed 60** | separate record; **both** or the transformation is a downgrade |
| `DLC2Miraak` | `017F7D:Dragonborn.esm` | ×1 [35–**200**] → **fixed 65** | highest `CalcMaxLevel` in the game |
| `DLC2MiraakMQ06` | `01FB98:Dragonborn.esm` | ×1.1 [35–150] → **fixed 65** | the final-fight record |
| `EncBandit04TemplateMelee` | `01E60D:Skyrim.esm` | level **0 → 14** | the vanilla bug, `tiers.md` §10 |

These six *could* be rules (`skypatcher.md` §4.1 does NPC levels natively). They are in the plugin
because they are a fixed, named, six-item list where an override is more legible than a filter, and
because putting them here means they are covered by xEdit and the Spriggit round-trip.

### 2.5 FormID budget — zero for the records in §2, but no longer zero overall

> **Revised 2026-07-29.** Everything enumerated in §2 is still an override. But §6.4 now adds **~7
> new wilderness `ECZN`**, and `probe-test-protocol.md` §6.3 may add per-tier gear lists and outfits.
> So the headline below — "FormID usage: none, after Phase 4" — **no longer holds**, and a block does
> need claiming. The ESL *verdict* is unaffected: tens of records against 2,048 slots.

**Every record above is an override.** Overrides keep the original master's FormKey suffix and consume
no new FormIDs. So:

- **CLAUDE.md's "FormID usage: none. Next free `0x800`" remains true after Phase 4.** No block needs
  claiming and `/formkey-check` has nothing to audit.
- **ESL-flagging is viable**, because the `0x800–0xFFF` constraint binds only new records. `Ehlnofey.esp`
  can be ESPFE and cost no load-order slot. This resolves CLAUDE.md's open "ESL decision".

If a later phase adds new records — most likely region-scoped leveled lists for the overworld problem
(§6) — the ESL decision reopens and a block gets claimed then, not now.

---

## 3. Why the zones moved into the plugin

CLAUDE.md assumed the zone work belonged in rules because option A's *ceiling* is frightening: Requiem
is 108 MB / 26,620 records, MLU 22 MB / 4,751. But that ceiling is set by **NPC and leveled-list**
overrides, not by zones. `morrowloot.md` §8.3 measured the zone slice directly:

> *"360 `ECZN` records is ~1 MB of YAML — a hand-authorable, reviewable, diffable core."*

355 two-field records is a **small** plugin, and once that is true the balance inverts:

| | Zones as plugin overrides | Zones as SkyPatcher rules |
|---|---|---|
| Authoring cost | 355 YAML records | 355 enumerated INI lines — **the same**, because `encounterzone/` has no keyword or location filter (`skypatcher.md` §5.3) |
| Verification | xEdit, `formkey-check`, Spriggit round-trip, `Test-RecordYaml.ps1` — **all apply** | **none apply.** A typo'd FormID fails silently |
| Conflicts | record-level; last plugin wins | none |
| Dependency | none | **SKSE**, version-bound |
| Uninstall | zone keeps its stored level until reset | same (engine property, `engine-behaviour.md` §5.2) |

The authoring cost is a wash — **SkyPatcher would have to enumerate the same 355 zones by FormID
anyway**, because the chain `LCTN keyword → ECZN level` is broken at both ends. So the rules route
buys conflict-freedom and pays with the entire verification toolchain.

**Guardrail 6 decides it.** *"A clean build is not a working mod"* is a warning that building proves
less than running — but under option B for the zones there is **no build to be clean at all**
(`skypatcher.md` §5.5). For the mod's *spine* — the one artefact that, if wrong, makes everything
wrong — giving up xEdit, Spriggit diffs and FormKey auditing in exchange for conflict-freedom with a
small number of other encounter-zone mods is a bad trade.

---

## 4. Why not option A (everything in the plugin)

The ~454 `PcLevelMult` actors are the reason.

| | Overrides | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| Guards, soldiers, hunters, Nightingales, `WE*` | ~454 `NPC_` records, the largest record type in the game | **~6 lines** |
| Catches NPCs from *other* mods | no | **yes** — `filterByPCLevelMult=true` is a predicate over whatever is loaded |
| Catches NPCs from future DLC/patches | no | **yes** |
| Follower exception | manual | `filterByFactionsExcluded` |

`skypatcher.md` §4.1 gives the primitive, and it needs **both** halves or it fails badly:

```ini
; class D -> fixed. setPcLevelMult=false alone leaves them at level 1000; level= alone leaves the flag set.
filterByPCLevelMult=true:filterByEditorIdContainsOr=Guard:setPcLevelMult=false=21:level=21
```

An enumeration of 454 records is a *snapshot*; a filter is a *rule*. For a category defined by "uses
player scaling", the rule is the correct expression of the intent, and it is the single place where
option B is clearly better rather than merely cheaper.

The same argument covers the ambient leveled lists (`difficulty-map.md` §4.1 option b):
`clear` + `addToLLs` + `calcLevelAndEachItem` expresses a flattening in one line per list.

---

## 5. Why not option B (everything in rules)

1. **GMSTs and globals are unreachable** — 15 of the 376 plugin records simply have no rule form
   (`skypatcher.md` §5.1; no `global` module at all). A plugin is required regardless, so the question
   was only ever *how big*, never *whether*.
2. **`LevelModifier` is unreachable** — the string does not appear anywhere in SkyPatcher's source
   (`skypatcher.md` §5.2). Ehlnofey does not need to *edit* it, but if `tiers.md` §4's `None` test goes
   the wrong way, **only a plugin can do it** (§7). Note this argument carries far less weight than it
   was originally given: the exposure is **9 records, not ~1,928** (§7.1).
3. **Verification** — §3.
4. **SKSE dependency on the core.** Under the chosen split, SKSE is required for the *actor* half; if
   SkyPatcher breaks on a game update, the world still has its fixed places and its GMSTs. Under
   option B a broken DLL means the mod does nothing at all. **Graceful degradation is a real benefit
   of the split** and it was not part of the original argument.

---

## 6. The overworld — SOLVED (revised 2026-07-29)

> **This section previously read "The unsolved problem, stated honestly" and shipped a partial fix.**
> It was costed against a census that was never taken. Now that the Tamriel worldspace has actually
> been scanned, the job is **65 leveled lists and 238 cells**, and it is fully tractable. The old
> text is superseded; the reasoning that replaced it is below.

### 6.1 What the overworld actually contains

Full scan of `reference/…/Worldspaces/Tamriel - 00003C_Skyrim.esm` — 12,148 exterior cell files,
1.3 GB, every `PlacedNpc` base resolved through its template chain. All `[verified]`:

| | count |
|---|---|
| Tamriel exterior cell files | 12,148 |
| …carrying an `EncounterZone` | **40 (0.3%)**, referencing 16 distinct zones |
| …containing any `PlacedNpc` | 1,919 |
| …containing a `PlacedNpc` **and** zoned | **33 (1.7%)** |
| unzoned leveled actor refs | **3,512** (vs 367 zoned) |

**But those 3,512 refs resolve to only 88 distinct leveled lists**, and 23 of them are *already flat*:

| | lists | refs |
|---|---|---|
| already flat — nothing to do | 23 | 2,460 |
| **level-gated — the real job** | **65** | **1,052** |

The flat 23 include `LCharSoldierImperial`, `LCharSoldierSons` (all 943 Civil War refs) and
`LCharAmbientCreatures` / `…Snow` (623 refs). **The single biggest block of overworld actors was
never a scaling problem.**

**The reframing that unlocks this: you fix 65 lists, not 12,148 cells.**

### 6.2 It is two populations, not one

**(a) Wildlife — flatten the lists. Regional variation survives for free.**

Vanilla already partitions wilderness spawns by biome `[verified]`: `LCharAnimalForestPredator`,
`…PlainsPredator`, `…CanyonPredator`, `…MarshPredator`, `…MountainSnowPredator`,
`…CoastSnowPredator`, `…ForestSnowPredator`, `LCharAnimalHills`, `LCharAnimalSnowFields`, each with a
prey counterpart, plus `LCharMudcrab` (209 refs), `LCharBearPlainsForestHills`, `LCharSpriggan`,
`LCharWitchAny`. Flattening **each list to its own fixed roster** gives fixed *and* regionally varied
wildlife, with **zero new records**.

> **This retracts the old §6's central objection** — that flattening yields "one wilderness mix for
> the whole province", and that regional variation "needs new records and reopens the ESL decision".
> Bethesda already did the partitioning; Ehlnofey only has to freeze each list in place.

**(b) Humanoids — cannot be flattened; they are shared with the dungeons.**

`LCharBanditMissile` (93 overworld refs), `LCharBanditMelee1HTank` (25), `LCharBanditWizard` (18),
`LCharForswornMissile` (35), `LCharForswornMelee1H` (30), `LCharWarlockNecromancer` (16) and friends
are **the same lists the 355 dungeon zones tier**. Flattening them would destroy the zone tiering
that `probe-test-protocol.md` §5 test 2a proved works. ~250 refs sit on lists that must stay gated.

For those the answer is to give the cells a zone — and the count is the thing the old §6 got wrong:
**238 unzoned Tamriel exterior cells contain humanoid-list spawns.** Not thousands. That is an
enumerable list.

### 6.3 What SkyPatcher can and cannot do here — read from source

All `[verified]` against `reference/mods/SkyPatcherSrc/cell.cpp`:

| Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `encounterZone=` can **attach** a zone to a cell that has none | ✅ `cell.cpp:781–802` — adds a new `ExtraEncounterZone` when absent, overwrites when present. Exactly what the overworld needs |
| cell rules have "**no keyword** filter" (`skypatcher.md` §4.4) | ❌ **wrong** — `filterByKeywords` / `Or` / `Excluded` exist |
| …but is that useful? | **No.** **0 of 12,148** Tamriel exterior cells carry any `Keywords`. The filter exists and the data is empty |
| `filterBySkyRegion` is a region filter | ⚠️ it reads `ExtraCellSkyRegion` (XCCM), and **0 of 12,148** Tamriel cells set it. Matches nothing |
| a general region filter on `Regions` (XCLR) | ❌ does not exist — though **6,999 cells do populate `Regions`**, so this is the one filter worth requesting upstream |
| cell rules have no **location** filter | ✅ correct, and 930 exterior cells do carry a `Location` |

**So the region shortcut is dead and the 238 cells must be enumerated by FormID.** That is fine:
`filterByCells=` takes a list, so the whole overworld is **one rule line per tier**, ~7 lines total.

**Rules beat plugin records here**, unusually for this project: an exterior-cell override in the
plugin carries the whole cell record and conflicts with every mod that touches that cell's lighting,
water or occlusion. A SkyPatcher `cell/` rule sets only the zone pointer and conflicts with nothing.

### 6.4 The plan

| Step | Where | Size |
|---|---|---|
| New wilderness `ECZN` records, one per tier | **plugin** | **~7 new records** — the mod's first |
| Assign them to the 238 humanoid-bearing cells, tier by region (`regions.md`'s gradient) | rules — `cell/` | ~7 lines |
| Flatten the ~18 biome wildlife lists, each to its own roster | rules — `leveledList/` | ~18 rules |
| `LCharDragonAny` (11 refs, gated 1/18/27/36/45) + the 8 unzoned dragon lairs | either | 1 decision |
| The 23 already-flat lists | — | leave alone |

**This reopens the ESL decision** (§2.5), which had been closed on "no new records at all". Seven
wilderness zones — plus whatever the gear work in `probe-test-protocol.md` §6.3 needs — are nowhere
near ESL's 2,048-slot `0x800–0xFFF` range, so the answer is unchanged; but the *premise* has changed
and §2.5 should no longer say the mod adds no records.

**Scope:** Tamriel only. Solstheim (`DLC2SolstheimWorld`) and the smaller worldspaces have not been
scanned, and per CLAUDE.md's DLC trap they must be measured separately rather than extrapolated.

---

## 7. What could still change this

Three tests, all cheap, all in one dungeon visit, and **two of them can move work across the
plugin/rules line**. They should be run before Phase 4 authoring starts, not after.

| Test | Source | If it goes the wrong way |
|---|---|---|
| **`LevelModifier: None`** — do unmodified placed refs honour the zone, or the player's level? | `tiers.md` §4, `engine-behaviour.md` §7, **`probe-test-protocol.md` §4** | **9** interior `PlacedNpc` refs need an explicit modifier. **Plugin-only** (§5.2), but 9 records is noise against 376. **Downgraded** — see the census below. |
| **NPC gear resolution** — NPC's level or player's level? | `loot-model.md` §3 | up to 1,378 `LVLI` need truncation. Rules can do it (`removeFromLLs`), so it lands in the rules half — but it stops being a handful of lines. |
| **`fSpecialLootMinPCLevelMult` = 0** — zone-locks special loot, or disables it? | `loot-model.md` §4 | revert to 0.6 and document the exception; the plugin loses one record. |

Everything else `engine-behaviour.md` set out to answer is settled: clamp scope, the `PcLevelMult`
exemption, zero-width bands, `LevelModifier` composition, and SkyPatcher's `kDataLoaded` timing and
save behaviour.

### 7.1 Correction — the `LevelModifier: None` exposure is 9 records, not ~1,928

**This section previously sized the `None` test as "~1,928 interior `PlacedNpc` refs need an explicit
modifier… roughly *sextuples* the plugin… the single highest-value test in the project". That is
wrong, and the error is a sizing error, not an engine one.** The open question in §4 of
`engine-behaviour.md` stands exactly as posed; only its cost does not.

`LevelModifier` multiplies the **leveled-list lookup level** (`engine-behaviour.md` §4). It therefore
does nothing at all unless the placed ref's base resolves — through its template chain — to an
`LVLN`. A fixed-level `NPC_` has no lookup to modify, and a `PcLevelMult` actor ignores encounter
zones outright (`engine-behaviour.md` §1) and is already the rules half's job. The ~1,928 figure came
from counting *unmodified placed refs* without asking whether any of them had a leveled ladder
behind them.

Census over all **291 zoned interior cells** of `Skyrim.esm`, resolving every `PlacedNpc` base to a
terminal class. `[verified]` — `reference/Base/01Skyrim/Cells/`, method and full listing in
`probe-test-protocol.md` §4:

| Base resolves to | no `LevelModifier` | modifier set | total |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`LVLN`** — the only class the modifier affects | **9** | 2,138 | 2,147 |
| `NPC_` with a fixed level | 1,014 | 190 | 1,204 |
| `NPC_` with `PcLevelMult` | 83 | 45 | 128 |
| | **1,106** | 2,373 | **3,479** |

Vanilla is, in other words, **99.6% consistent**: of 2,147 placed refs backed by a leveled ladder in
a zoned interior, all but 9 carry a modifier. The 1,014 unmodified fixed-level refs are corpses,
skeletons, skeevers and quest NPCs — inert to this question either way.

All nine, should the test go the wrong way: `Ustengrav01` `02137C` `02137D` `02137E` `0213C6` (four
bandits), `WolfSkullCave02` `09DA1F`–`09DA22` (`MS06NecromancerCultist1–4`), `SnaplegCave01`
`0694D1` (`LvlDeer`).

**Consequences for this document:**

1. **The test is downgraded from schedule-defining to routine.** Still run it — it is free, it is one
   `getlevel`, and it fixes the semantics for any ref Ehlnofey places itself — but §9 step 1 no longer
   gates on it in the way it was written to.
2. **§2's ~376-record estimate stands** in both branches. The worst case adds 9 placed-ref overrides
   (~385), not ~2,300.
3. **§5.2's argument is unchanged but its stakes shrink.** `LevelModifier` is still unreachable from
   SkyPatcher and still plugin-only; the slice that would move is simply 9 records, so it is no longer
   an argument of any weight against option B.
4. **The gear-resolution test (row 2) is now the largest live risk in the table** — up to 1,378 `LVLI`.
   It is the one to run first.

**Scope caveat:** `Skyrim.esm` interiors only. `Worldspaces/` and the DLC were not censused, and per
CLAUDE.md's DLC trap (b) they must be checked separately rather than extrapolated. `Worldspaces/` has
since been censused in its own right — see the rewritten §6.

---

## 8. What Phase 4 has to build that this workspace does not have

`skypatcher.md` §6 is blunt about the cost and it is the one genuinely new engineering task:

> *"The workspace's whole verification toolchain does not apply. Rules are unverifiable except
> in-game. Ehlnofey would need a new kind of check."*

**Deliverable: a SkyPatcher rule linter**, run in CI alongside `build.ps1`. Minimum viable scope,
taken from the two failure modes `skypatcher.md` actually documents:

1. **Resolve every `Plugin.esp|FormID` in every INI against `reference/`** — a typo'd FormID logs
   `logger::critical` and is otherwise silent.
2. **Validate every key name against the parser's regexes**, not against the author's articles. §3.4
   of `skypatcher.md` found *two* documented keys that do not work as written
   (`calcForLevelAndEachItem`, and `minLevelMult`'s `stoi` truncation), both failing silently.
3. **Warn on `filterBy*` stacking**, which *widens* the match (union) where `restrictTo*` narrows it
   (intersection) — the mistake that silently patches more NPCs than intended.
4. **Check `int8` bounds** on every `minLevel`/`maxLevel` — out-of-range values are rejected and
   ignored.

Note (1) needs `reference/`, which is gitignored, so it cannot run in CI as-is; the practical form is
a committed FormID→EditorID index built once from `reference/` and validated against in CI. That index
is worth having anyway — CLAUDE.md's gotchas already recommend it.

**Also required:** ship the rules under a mod-specific subfolder —
`SKSE/Plugins/SkyPatcher/npc/Ehlnofey/…`, never `SkyPatcher/npc/Skyrim.esm.ini`, which collides with
every other mod in the mod manager (`skypatcher.md` §3.3). And use the plugin-conditional filename
mechanism for DLC rules (`Ehlnofey_Dawnguard.esm.ini` loads only if Dawnguard is present) — free
compatibility, no scripting.

---

## 9. Phase 4 order of work

1. **Run the three tests** (§7), using `EhlnofeyProbe.esp` — the instrument and the script are in
   `probe-test-protocol.md`. Do not author against an assumption. **Run the gear-resolution test
   first**: since §7.1 it is the only one of the three that can still move a large amount of work
   (up to 1,378 `LVLI`).
2. **Delete `src/ExampleMod/`.** CLAUDE.md marks it as a template artefact to remove before first
   release.
3. **Scaffold `Ehlnofey.esp`** via the `mod-new-plugin` skill — header, masters, `build/manifest.json`
   entry. No FOMOD: one `.esp`, nothing to choose, so the release ships `"fomod": false`.
4. **The 15 constants first** (§2.2, §2.3). Smallest possible slice that is verifiable end-to-end:
   deserialize → xEdit check → `package-mod` → `mod-deploy` → launch. Proves the pipeline before
   355 records ride on it.
5. **The 355 zones** (§2.1), generated from `difficulty-map.md` rather than hand-typed — guardrail 3,
   *copy records verbatim, never retype hex*.
6. **The 6 named records** (§2.4).
7. **The rule linter** (§8), then the rules: `npc/` first (class D is where bone 1 actually lives),
   then `leveledList/` for the ambient flattening.
8. **Launch and walk into a zone.** Guardrail 6: a clean build proves it builds. Phase 4 is done when
   a character has walked into a T5 crypt and been correctly killed by it.

---

## 10. Summary of the decision

| Question | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Architecture | **Hybrid — places and constants in the plugin, actors in rules** |
| Plugin size | **~376 records**, all overrides, ~1–2 MB YAML |
| New records | **none** — FormID usage stays at zero, next free `0x800` |
| ESL | **viable and taken** (ESPFE), reopens only if new records are added |
| Masters | `Skyrim.esm`, `Update.esm`, `Dawnguard.esm`, `Dragonborn.esm` |
| Rules | SkyPatcher `npc/` + `leveledList/`, under `SkyPatcher/<type>/Ehlnofey/` |
| Hard dependency | **SKSE + SkyPatcher**, for the actor half only; the plugin half degrades gracefully |
| Bash tags | none needed by default — Ehlnofey edits no leveled item lists (`loot-model.md` §6) |
| Save games | **new game recommended** (`engine-behaviour.md` §5.2) |
| Synthesis | **ruled out**, per CLAUDE.md. Not revisited. |

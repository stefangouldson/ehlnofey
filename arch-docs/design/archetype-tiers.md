# Archetype tiers — the roster table

**Phase 4, step 2** of `requiem-method.md` §6. Under the Requiem-method architecture the tier ladder
stops indexing *places* and starts indexing *creature families*: a flattened list has one fixed
roster, and that roster is what a player meets everywhere the list is placed.

This document assigns that roster, for every archetype, once.

Read `requiem-method.md` first. Inputs: `tiers.md` (the ladder), `enemy-taxonomy.md` §2 (the vanilla
ladders, `[verified]`), `lore-constraints.md` §1 (the display-name hierarchy, `[verified]`).

**The ladder, unchanged:** `T1 = 4 · T2 = 8 · T3 = 14 · T4 = 21 · T5 = 30 · T6 = 40 · T7 = 50`.

---

## 1. Four rules that generate every row

### Rule 1 — keep vanilla's tier records exactly as they are

**Do not re-level the tier NPCs.** `enemy-taxonomy.md` §3 measured why: level and capability are
welded into the same record. `EncBandit01TemplateMelee` (L=1) is 35 health and one perk that
*reduces* its damage; `EncBandit06TemplateMelee` (L=25) is 489 health and eleven perks including the
skill-60 ranks. `[verified]` Editing a level without re-perking produces an incoherent actor, and
re-perking 300 records is a combat overhaul — an explicit non-goal.

So Ehlnofey never writes a level onto a tier record. **The only decision is which rungs stay in the
pool.** Everything Bethesda tuned is preserved, and the tier label is descriptive: it names the
nearest rung on the ladder.

### Rule 2 — flatten the gate, keep a *weighted* pool

Every surviving rung goes in at `Level: 1` with `CalculateFromAllLevelsLessThanOrEqualPlayer` set, so
all rungs are always eligible and one is drawn at random. Weight by **repeating the entry**:
`Bandit ×3` means the entry appears three times.

> **Correction to `requiem-method.md` §4.4.** Weighting is *literal entry duplication*, not a `Count`
> field. `Count` is how many actors the entry spawns; `CalculateForEachItemInCount` rolls each of
> them separately. Requiem's `_CLI_` convention writes `Count: 5` as authoring shorthand and its
> **patcher unrolls it into five entries** (`lessons-for-ehlnofey.md` §4) — the engine has no weight
> field. Ehlnofey has no patcher, so it writes the duplicates out. Costs bytes, needs nothing.

### Rule 3 — a roster spans at most three adjacent tiers, and the top rung is rare

This is the bone-2 constraint doing real work. A pool spanning the whole ladder is not a fixed
difficulty, it is *random* difficulty, and a camp whose danger cannot be predicted is illegible
however fixed its distribution. Narrow band, weighted toward the middle, one visible top rung for
texture. **The archetype's tier is the band's centre**, and that is the number the player learns.

### Rule 4 — the name must match the tier

`lore-constraints.md` §1: the display names *are* the legibility mechanism. A rung stays in the pool
under its vanilla name or not at all. Where a name implies a rung above the band — Valkynaz, Volkihar
Master, Arch Conjurer — the rung is **reserved for named, summoned or boss placements**, never
dropped and never demoted.

---

## 2. The calibration check — three ladders land 1:1 on the ladder

`lore-constraints.md` §5.2 set the test: *"if a proposed tier system cannot express the Dremora ladder
cleanly, the tier system is wrong."* It expresses it exactly. `[verified]`

| Tier | `N` | **Dremora** | **Warlock** | **Vampire** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | 4 | — | Wizard (1) | Fledgling (1) |
| T2 | 8 | **Churl** (6) | Apprentice Conjurer (6) | Vampire (6) |
| T3 | 14 | **Caitiff** (12) | Conjurer Adept (12) | Blooded (12) |
| T4 | 21 | **Kynval** (19) | Conjurer (19) | Mistwalker (20) |
| T5 | 30 | **Kynreeve** (27) | Ascendant Conjurer (27) | Nightstalker (28) |
| T6 | 40 | **Markynaz** (36) | Master Conjurer (36) | Ancient (38) |
| T7 | 50 | **Valkynaz** (46) | Arch Conjurer (46) | Volkihar (48) |

Three independent vanilla ladders, one of them documented in an in-game book, all seven rungs, no
collisions. The draugr ladder does the same across T1–T5 — unsurprising, since `tiers.md` §3 derived
the steps from it, but the Dremora and Vampire agreement is a genuine external check.

**Consequence:** the tier number is a real cross-archetype currency. That closes
`lore-constraints.md` §6.1's open question — *"is a Draugr Scourge more dangerous than a Forsworn
Ravager?"* Under this table, **yes-or-no is answerable: they are both T5, so they are equals.**
Vanilla could not answer it because the ladders were indexed by player level, not by a shared scale.

---

## 3. Class A — the tier ladders

The main table. `Vanilla rungs` are name (level) from `lore-constraints.md` §1 and
`enemy-taxonomy.md` §2, all `[verified]`. `Roster` is the flattened pool with weights.
**Bold** = the band centre, i.e. the archetype's tier.

#### 3.1.1 The naming test — a band is only allowed where the rungs have different names

Found in play (2026-07-30): the Swindler's Den chief was a lottery. That turned out to be the
pre-bucket-D naive flatten, but investigating it exposed a rule this table had been breaking.

`requiem-method.md` Twist 2 is the whole legibility argument after the pivot — *"the tier must agree
with the display name of everything in the pool"*, because with encounter zones gone the **name is
the only signal the player gets.** A ×2/×2/×1 band is therefore only legible if the three rungs
*have three names*. Test it, per family, before writing a band:

> Walk each rung's leaf to a `FULL`. A leaf with no name and no `Traits` in its `TemplateFlags`
> stops the chain — the name then falls through to the **placed reference's base**, which is a single
> record, so **every rung displays the same string**.

| Boss family | Rung names in vanilla | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Draugr | Overlord · Wight Lord · Scourge Lord · Death Overlord | **band OK** — 4 names, 4 rungs |
| Falmer | Skulker · Gloomlurker · Nightprowler · Shadowmaster | **band OK** |
| **Bandit** | *none* → `LvlBanditBoss` 03DF17 = "Bandit Chief" | **pinned to 28** |
| **Forsworn** | *none* → falls through to the placed base | band is illegible — unfixed |
| **Warlock** | *none* → falls through to the placed base | band is illegible — unfixed |
| **Thalmor** | "Thalmor Wizard" at all seven rungs | band is illegible — unfixed |
| **Vampire** | *none* → falls through to the placed base | band is illegible — unfixed |

So the bandit boss is pinned to a single rung: a Bandit Chief is the same level in Swindler's Den, in
Halted Stream and on Solstheim, forever. Gate 29 appears twice in the `*M` lists (1H and 2H) and
weight 1 keeps both, so the pin costs the level spread and nothing else — the 1H/2H and per-race
variety survives.

**The rung is 28 — the top of the vanilla ladder, ≈T5 — not the T4 rung 21** (decided 2026-07-30;
21 was the first pass). This is the one row in §3.1 where the band centre is *not* the right pin.
The reasoning is the camp, not the archetype: bandit mooks sit at **T2** and there is nothing else in
a bandit camp to carry difficulty, so the chief is the only fight in it that can. Pinning at 21 left
a T2 camp with a T4 capstone — a step, but a small one against a player who has any business being
there. 28 makes the chief a genuine wall, and it is still a *vanilla* rung, so no record is invented
and the gear the rung already carries (steel, dwarven) comes with it.

This is a deliberate consequence: **bandit camps become bimodal** — trivial mooks, dangerous chief.
That is the honest shape of a fixed world where one faction spans T1–T5, and §8's "bandits become
trivial after ~T3" warning applies to the mooks only, not to the capstone.

**The mook ladder passes the test and keeps its band**: 1 · 5 · 9 · 14 really are Bandit · Bandit
Outlaw · Bandit Thug · Bandit Highwayman, four levels behind four names. Only `EncBandit01*` is
nameless, and it is the rung the placed base's own name already describes.

**The other four families are a decision not yet taken**, not an oversight. Pinning them is the
consistent move, but it re-tiers four archetypes; the alternative is to author distinct rung names,
which invents lore vocabulary and makes `lore-constraints.md` the arbiter.

**The level-1 rung is rare, and it is called Bandit Runt** (revised 2026-07-30, after play).

It was `×3` — a third of every bandit drawn was the level-1 rung, which made a T2 archetype feel like
a T1 one. It is now `×1`, as rare as Highwayman at the top. The freed weight went to Outlaw and Thug
in the old 3:2:1 proportion (→ 4:3:1), so the roster's *shape* is unchanged and only the runt moved.
The pool is still 9 entries, so the odds read cleanly: **1/9 · 4/9 · 3/9 · 1/9**, and the mean drawn
level rises from 5.6 to 6.9 — much closer to T2's 8.

The rename is **the mod's first invented display name**, and it is deliberately the safest possible
one: it extends an existing ladder downward rather than inventing new tiers, and the rung it names
had no name of its own. Vanilla leaves all 44 `EncBandit01*` records with **no `FULL`**, so a level-1
bandit reads "Bandit" — inherited from `EncBandit00Template` 039CF4, the shared root of the family.

> **The first attempt failed in game, and the reason is still unknown** (2026-07-31). Every rung
> above 1 carries its `FULL` on a per-weapon *template* record — `EncBandit02TemplateMelee` is
> "Bandit Outlaw" — while that rung's per-race leaves carry none and do **not** set the `Traits`
> template flag. So naming the three `EncBandit01Template*` records should have worked by exact
> analogy. It did not: level-1 bandits still read "Bandit".
>
> It was not a stale file or a conflict. The deployed plugin was byte-identical to the build, the
> name was confirmed present by serializing the built binary back out, and `Ehlnofey.esp` loads
> **last** in the test bed, so it wins every conflict. The model of how a nameless leaf resolves its
> `FULL` is simply wrong, and this workspace cannot test the engine directly to find out how.
>
> **The fix does not depend on knowing.** `author-names.ps1` now names **all 44 records in the
> rung** — 3 templates plus 41 leaves (1H, 2H, Tank, Berserk, Magic, Missile, per race and sex) —
> so whichever record the engine actually reads, it finds the same string. Redundant under the
> inheritance model, correct under every model. This is the cheaper trade: records cost bytes, and
> another failed in-game test cycle costs a session.

`EncBandit00Template` 039CF4 is **left alone** and still reads "Bandit", so anything outside this
rung that falls through to it is untouched. Two non-bandits do template off the rung's records:
`encGhost01Magic` carries its own `FULL` ("Ghost") and is unaffected, and `dunLiarsRetreatWenchCorpse`
has none, so it becomes "Bandit Runt" — a dead level-1 bandit in a bandit dungeon that reads
"Bandit" today, which is correct, if drier. `DEMO_Bandit1HNordM` and `WarehouseNPCWebActorSit` are
dev-only records that are never placed in the playable world.

> **Consistency note.** §3.1.1 chose to *pin* the bandit chief rather than invent names for its
> rungs, and four boss families are still open on that basis. Naming the runt does not reopen it:
> "Runt" sits below an existing six-name ladder, where the boss case would need three new coinages
> inserted *into* one. If that ever becomes acceptable, §3.1.1's second option unblocks.

**Vigilants are the precedent, not the bug.** `enemy-taxonomy.md` §2.1 flags them as the one vanilla
humanoid faction that already satisfies bone 1. They need no edit and they are proof the shape works.

**Penitus Oculatus fixes itself.** Vanilla's ladder is inverted — gates reach 46 but the top tier is
level 23, so they get *relatively weaker* as the player levels `[verified]`. Flattening deletes the
inversion; no special handling.

**`LCharOrcMelee` is the only place Bandit Plunderer survives, and it is six placements.** This row
was labelled "Orc stronghold", which is half right at best. The list is reached by four base records,
and their placements across the whole base game are `[verified]`:

| Base record | Where | Count |
|---|---|---:|
| `DA06LvlOrcMelee` 08CDA2 | *The Cursed Tribe* — Largashbur, a real stronghold | 3 |
| `LvlOrcMelee` 01E7BB · `LvlOrcMelee_Aggro1024` 0D1FBA | **Rift Watchtower** | 2 |
| `LvlOrcMelee_Aggro1024` 0D1FBA | **Cracked Tusk Keep** | 1 |
| `WE24Orc` 062128 | a world encounter — spawned, never placed | 0 |

So two thirds of it is Orc-manned *bandit* forts, not strongholds. The stronghold Orcs you can walk
up to and talk to at Dushnikh Yal, Mor Khazgur and Narzulbur are **not** on this list at all — they
are unique `NPC_` records, class C, and nothing in this document touches them.

**Nothing was moved into this list.** Vanilla's `LCharOrcMelee` already held all six bandit rungs
(gates 1/5/9/14/19/25); the roster above simply bands it **one rung higher** than the ordinary bandit
list — T3 (Outlaw→Plunderer) against T2 (Bandit→Highwayman). That single-rung offset is the entire
reason Plunderer has anywhere left to appear.

**Bandit Marauder (level 25) survives in zero lists** — checked against every `LVLN` in the built
plugin. It is the one vanilla rung the mod deletes outright from ordinary spawns. `EncBandit06Boss*`
(level 28) is a different record set and is very much still in play: it is what the pinned chief
draws from.

### 3.2 Draugr — the anchor ladder

The rungs are **sublists**, not NPCs — `SubCharDraugr0N<role>` `[verified]` — so a roster is expressed
by keeping and re-weighting the sublist references. Bethesda's own head-variant weighting inside them
(`SubCharDraugr04Melee2HMSublist` repeats `HeadM01/02/03` three times each) is left untouched.

| List | Vanilla rungs | **Ehlnofey roster** | Band |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LCharDraugrMelee1HMale` 055936, `Melee2H` 01E772, `Missile` 0A6844 | Draugr 1 · Restless 6 · Wight 13 · Scourge 21 · Deathlord 30 · Ebony Deathlord 40 | `SubCharDraugr02` Restless ×3 · **`SubCharDraugr03` Wight ×3** · `SubCharDraugr04` Scourge ×2 | **T3** (T2–T4) |
| `LCharDraugrWarlockMale` 0BF7BB | 6 · 13 · 21 | 6 ×1 · **13 ×3** · 21 ×2 | **T3** (T2–T4) |
| `LCharDraugrBoss` 042480 | Overlord 7 · Wight Lord 15 · Scourge Lord 24 · Death Overlord 34 · 45 · 50 | Wight Lord ×2 · **Scourge Lord ×3** · **Deathlord ×2** · Death Overlord ×2 · 45 ×1 | **T4** (T3–T6) |
| `LCharDraugrBossNoDragonPriest` 0DD9D8 | 7 · 15 · 24 · 34 · 45 | same as above, minus the priest attachment | **T4** |

**Narrowed from T1–T5 to T2–T4 (2026-07-29).** The draft gave draugr the widest band in the table on
the argument that, with the tomb gone as an input, the *spread* had to carry the texture. Rejected:
a five-tier pool is not a fixed difficulty, it is a random one, and §1 rule 3 exists precisely to stop
that. A barrow is now reliably Restless→Wight→Scourge, and reads as one place rather than a lottery.

Two rungs leave the generic pool, and rule 4 says reserve rather than drop:

- **Deathlord (L=30, T5) moves to the boss list**, at ×2. That is where a player meets one in practice
  — guarding the word wall or the sarcophagus — and L=30 sits neatly between Scourge Lord (24) and
  Death Overlord (34), so the boss band absorbs it without stretching.
- **The Ebony Deathlord** (gate 40) is the same L=30 actor in better gear `[verified]` — a *gear*
  upgrade, not a tier. It follows the Deathlord into boss placements.

**One consequence to decide separately:** the plain **Draugr (L=1)** now appears in no generic pool at
all, so the archetype's own base name effectively leaves the game. That is defensible — a tomb full
of Restless Draugr is a better tomb — but it is a legibility cost under rule 4, and the cheapest
mitigation is to keep `SubCharDraugr01` ×1 on the *Missile* list only, where a weak skirmisher reads
naturally. **Flagged, not taken.**

**And it raises the floor.** The old pool was 2/9 plain Draugr; the new floor is Restless (L=6). Every
Nordic tomb in the game gets harder at the bottom and easier at the top. **Bleak Falls Barrow is the
one to watch** — it is main-quest-critical and reached at character level ~2–5.

**Lore invariant preserved:** the Dragon Priest (fixed 50, T7) outranks every draugr in his barrow —
the boss band tops at 45. `[verified]` against `lore-constraints.md` §3.

### 3.3 Falmer, Dwemer, Dremora

| Archetype | List | Vanilla rungs | **Ehlnofey roster** | Band |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Falmer** (melee/missile) | `LCharFalmerMelee` 01E77D | Falmer 9 · Skulker 15 · Gloomlurker 22 · Nightprowler 30 · Shadowmaster 38 | Falmer ×2 · **Skulker ×3** · Gloomlurker ×2 · Nightprowler ×1 | **T3** (T2–T5) |
| Falmer (shaman) | `LCharFalmerShaman` 01E77F | 5 · 8 · 14 · 19 · 25 | 14 ×2 · **19 ×2** · 25 ×1 | **T4** (T3–T5) |
| Falmer (boss) | `LCharFalmerBoss` 05238F | 18 · 26 · 35 · 44 | 26 ×2 · **35 ×2** · 44 ×1 | **T5** (T4–T6) |
| **Dwarven spider** | `LCharDwarvenSpider` 10EC90 | 6 · 12 · 16 | 12 ×2 · **16 ×2** | **T3** (T3–T4) |
| **Dwarven sphere** | `LCharDwarvenSphere` 10EC8F | 16 · 24 · 30 | 16 ×1 · **24 ×3** · 30 ×1 | **T4** (T4–T5) |
| **Dwarven centurion** | `LCharDwarvenCenturion` 10FCE5 | 24 · 30 · 36 | **30 ×2** · 36 ×1 | **T5** (T5–T6) |
| Dwarven mixed | `LCharDwarvenAutomaton` 01E783 | 6 · 12 · 16 · 24 · 30 · 36 | spider 16 ×3 · **sphere 24 ×3** · centurion 30 ×1 | **T4** (T4–T5) |
| **Dremora** | `LCharDremoraMelee` 01E79B | Churl 6 · Caitiff 12 · Kynval 19 · Kynreeve 27 · Markynaz 36 · Valkynaz 46 | Churl ×2 · **Caitiff ×3** · Kynval ×3 · Kynreeve ×1 | **T3** (T2–T5) |

**The Falmer shaman defect is closed by construction.** Vanilla caps shamans at 25 while melee Falmer
reach 38 `[verified]`; `lore-constraints.md` permits closing it. The rosters above put shamans at T4
and melee at T3, so the caster is now the *stronger* of the pair — which is what a hive's spellcaster
should be, and it costs nothing but rung selection.

**Automatons are the safest hard-fix in the game** (`lore-constraints.md` §3): machines in a sealed
ruin, fictionally static, with a clean Spider < Sphere < Centurion order that vanilla already honours.

**Markynaz (T6) and Valkynaz (T7) are reserved**, per rule 4 and the in-game book's *"the Valkynaz are
rarely encountered on Tamriel"* `[verified]`. They appear only via conjuration and named placements —
which also satisfies `lore-constraints.md` §4 item 5: a Master Conjurer (T6) summons a Markynaz (T6),
in step.

### 3.4 Dragons and the DLC families

| Archetype | List | Vanilla rungs | **Ehlnofey roster** | Band |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dragon** | `LCharDragonAny` 05EACF | Dragon 10 · Blood 20 · Frost 30 · Elder 40 · Ancient 50 | Dragon ×2 · **Blood ×3** · Frost ×2 · Elder ×1 | **T4** (T3–T6) |
| Dragon (Solstheim) | `DLC2LCharDragonAny` 036135 | + 58 | as above · Elder ×2 · 58 ×1 | **T5** (T4–T6) |
| **Riekling** | `DLC2LCharRieklingMelee` 01B653 | 6 · 11 · 16 · 23 | 6 ×2 · **11 ×3** · 16 ×2 | **T2** (T2–T4) |
| **Ash Spawn** | `DLC2LCharAshSpawnAll` 0322BD | 20 — single gate | *(unchanged — already flat)* | **T4** |
| **Cultist** | `DLC2LCharCultist` 030CDC | 12 · 19 · 27 · 36 · 46 | 19 ×2 · **27 ×3** · 36 ×1 | **T5** (T4–T6) |
| **Seeker** | `DLC2LCharSeeker` 028E87 | 21 · 32 · 42 | 21 ×1 · **32 ×3** · 42 ×1 | **T5** (T4–T6) |
| **Lurker** | `DLC2LCharLurker` 01B64D | 24 · 34 · 44 · 54 | 34 ×2 · **44 ×2** | **T6** (T5–T6) |
| **Gargoyle** | `LCharGargoyle` 017704 | 13 · 25 · 43 | 13 ×1 · **25 ×3** · 43 ×1 | **T4** (T3–T6) |
| **Chaurus Hunter** | `DLC1LCharChaurusHunter` 0029A2 | 16 · 32 | 16 ×2 · **32 ×1** | **T4** (T4–T5) |
| **Armored Troll** | `DLC1LCharTrollArmored` 00D0BB | 14 · 22 | 14 ×2 · **22 ×1** | **T3** (T3–T4) |
| **Solstheim bandit** | `DLC2LCharBanditMelee1H` 01E8A9 | parallel records, 1–25 | **mirror §3.1's mainland bandit exactly** | **T2** |

**Apocrypha stays flat and high** — `lore-constraints.md` §3 explicitly permits it: *"one realm,
entered by one means, and Mora's servants have no reason to be graded by which book you opened."*
Seekers T5, Lurkers T6, no internal gradient.

**Solstheim's higher ceiling is kept** (`lore-constraints.md` §5.5), not normalised away: its dragons,
Lurkers and Acolytes all sit above their mainland equivalents.

## 4. Class B — species substitution and the biome lists

Different mechanism, different fix. `enemy-taxonomy.md` §2.3: **creature levels are already fixed on
the record**; the leveled list substitutes a *species* as the player levels. Flattening therefore does
not set a level — it fixes **which animals live where**.

| List | Vanilla substitution | **Ehlnofey roster** |
|---|---|---|
| `LCharFrostbiteSpider` 01E77C | Spider 1 → Large 6 → Giant 14 | Spider ×3 · **Large ×3** · Giant ×1 |
| `LCharBearAll` 042266 | Bear 12 → Cave 16 → Snow 20 | **Bear ×3** · Cave ×2 · Snow ×1 |
| `LCharBearPlainsForestHills` 01E796 | Bear 12 → Cave 16 | **Bear ×3** · Cave ×1 |
| `LCharSabrecat` 0FE2D5 | Sabre Cat 6 → Snowy 11 | **Sabre Cat ×3** · Snowy ×1 |
| `LCharChaurus` 01FA27 | Chaurus 12 → Reaper 20 | **Chaurus ×3** · Reaper ×1 |
| `LCharSpriggan` 10EC84 | Spriggan 8 → Matron 18 | **Spriggan ×3** · Matron ×1 |
| `LCharAtronach` 01E77A | Flame 5 → Frost 16 → Storm 30 | **Flame ×2 · Frost ×2 · Storm ×1** — summon-tier, keep the spread |
| `LCharMudcrab` 02183E | Medium 1 → Large → Giant | **Medium ×3** · Large ×2 · Giant ×1 |
| `LCharCustomIceWraithFrostTroll` 106386 | Ice Wraith 9 → Frost Troll 22 | **Ice Wraith ×2** · Frost Troll ×1 |

### 4.1 The biome ambient lists — enumerated

`requiem-method.md` §5.4: Bethesda **already partitions wilderness by biome** `[verified]`, so
flattening each list in place yields fixed *and* regionally varied wildlife with zero new records.
Pulled from `reference/` by `arch-docs/design/biome-rosters.ps1`. **19 lists exist**, not 18.

#### 4.1.1 The finding that decides how to flatten them

**The ambient lists are a density ramp, not a tier ladder.** They repeat the *same* creature at
successive gates, so as the player levels, more copies of the dangerous species enter the pool while
the harmless ones stay at a fixed count. `LCharAnimalForestPredator` (042297) in full `[verified]`:

```
Wolf@1 ×4  Skeever@1  SpiderLarge@6,7,8,10  Bear@12,13,13,14,14  Troll@14,15,15,16
BearCave@16,20,24,28,28,30,30,35
```

Eligible mix by player level — the same 26 entries, filtered:

| PC | eligible | mix |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 5 | Wolf ×4 · Skeever ×1 |
| 8 | 8 | Wolf ×4 · SpiderLarge ×3 · Skeever ×1 |
| **14** | 15 | **Bear ×5 · SpiderLarge ×4 · Wolf ×4 · Troll ×1 · Skeever ×1** |
| 21 | 20 | Bear ×5 · SpiderLarge ×4 · Troll ×4 · Wolf ×4 · BearCave ×2 · Skeever ×1 |
| 30 | 25 | **BearCave ×7** · Bear ×5 · Troll ×4 · Wolf ×4 · SpiderLarge ×4 · Skeever ×1 |

Two consequences, and the first is a trap:

1. **Naive flattening inherits the level-35 mix.** Move every entry to `Level: 1` and a Falkreath
   pine wood becomes cave-bear soup — 7 of 26 draws, the *most* dangerous composition vanilla ever
   produces. The flattening must therefore **target a reference level**, not just collapse the gates.
2. **It vindicates the weighting mechanism** (§1 rule 2): vanilla weights by literal entry
   duplication, exactly as Ehlnofey will. This is not an invented technique.

> **This refines `enemy-taxonomy.md` §2.3.** That section found the wilderness *already* effectively
> deleveled above ~level 20 — *"forest predators top out at a level-16 cave bear"* — and concluded the
> overworld gradient largely exists already. **True of the species ceiling, false of the
> composition:** the species stops climbing at 16 but its *share of the pool* keeps climbing to gate
> 35. The wilderness does not stop scaling at 20; it stops introducing new animals at 20 and goes on
> concentrating the worst one.

#### 4.1.2 The rule: freeze each biome at its own tier

Each list keeps **vanilla's own eligible mix, frozen at the reference level of the tier assigned to
that biome.** Zero invention — every roster below is a filtered vanilla list, and the weights are
Bethesda's.

| List | FormKey | **Tier** | **Roster (frozen mix)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LCharAnimalPlainsPredator` | 042293 | **T2** | Wolf ×4 · SabreCat ×1 · Skeever ×1 |
| `LCharAnimalForestPredator` | 042297 | **T3** | Bear ×5 · SpiderLarge ×4 · Wolf ×4 · Troll ×1 · Skeever ×1 |
| `LCharAnimalCanyonPredator` | 04229B | **T3** | Bear ×4 · Wolf ×4 · SabreCat ×3 · Skeever ×1 |
| `LCharAnimalMarshPredator` | 042295 | **T3** | Chaurus ×3 · SpiderLarge ×3 · Spider ×2 · Troll ×1 |
| `LCharAnimalHills` | 01E78F | **T3** | Bear ×3 · Wolf ×3 · SabreCat ×2 · Skeever ×1 |
| `LCharAnimalCoastSnowPredator` | 0422A3 | **T3** | SabreCatSnow ×4 · WolfIce ×4 · Wolf ×2 |
| `LCharAnimalForestSnowPredator` | 042299 | **T4** | IceWraith ×4 · SabreCatSnow ×3 · SpiderSnowLarge ×3 · BearSnow ×2 · SpiderSnow ×1 |
| `LCharAnimalMountainSnowPredator` | 04229D | **T5** | IceWraith ×4 · WolfIce ×4 · BearSnow ×3 · SabreCatSnow ×3 · **TrollFrost ×3** · Wolf ×2 |
| `LCharAnimalSnowFields` | 01E78E | **T4** | WolfIce ×3 · SabreCatSnow ×2 · IceWraith ×2 · BearSnow ×1 |
| `LCharAnimalForest` | 01E790 | **T3** | Bear ×2 · SabreCat ×2 · Wolf ×1 |
| `LCharAnimalPlains` | 01E78D | **T2** | Wolf ×3 · SabreCat ×1 |
| `DLC2LCharAnimalForestPredator` | 01E1C5:DB | **T3** | Bear ×5 · **BoarWild ×4** · Wolf ×4 · Troll ×1 · Skeever ×1 |
| `DLC2LCharAnimalMountainSnowPredator` | 01E1C6:DB | **T5** | as mainland mountain, BoarWild ×4 in place of the spiders |

**The gradient falls out geographically**: plains T2 → forest / canyon / marsh / hills / coast T3 →
snowy forest and snow fields T4 → **mountains T5**. That is a legible map with no zone anywhere in it.

> **Built 2026-07-30 by `src/Ehlnofey/author-bucket-d.ps1`.** The cap rule stated above reproduces
> this table **exactly** for all eight flagged predator lists — verified entry-for-entry against the
> built plugin. Two rows needed a decision, because the table and the prose disagree:
>
> - **`LCharAnimalSnowFields`** is listed with `IceWraith ×2`, but Ice Wraith sits at **gate 28**,
>   above T4's own reference level of 21. The build follows the rule, not the row:
>   `WolfIce ×3 · SabreCatSnow ×2 · BearSnow ×1 · Wolf ×1`. Frost Troll is excluded either way, so
>   §4.1.2's "T5 is the only band holding `TrollFrost`" still holds.
> - **`LCharMudcrab`** appears twice with different weights — `Medium ×3` in §4's substitution table,
>   `Medium ×2` in §4.1.4. The build uses **§4's** (`Medium ×3 · Large ×2 · Giant ×1`), since §4 is
>   the canonical table for species-substitution lists.
>
> The three unflagged lists (`LCharAnimalForest`, `…Plains`, `…SnowFields`) hold one entry per
> species, so a bare cap would give a flat 1:1:1 mix — the cap decides *which* species are in and
> the table's weights are applied on top.

**Mountains at T5 are doing specific work.** `tiers.md` §8 sets the twelve `LevelGate*` globals to 1,
which removes vanilla's only systematic protection against a level-5 character meeting a frost troll.
`lore-constraints.md` §4 item 4 says the geography must then carry the warning instead: *"frost trolls
belong on mountains, and the player must be able to see the mountain."* T5 is the only band whose
frozen mix contains `TrollFrost` — it appears at gate 28 and nowhere below. **The mountain is the
warning, and it is visible from anywhere in Skyrim.**

#### 4.1.3 Seven prey lists need no edit at all

Already flat, every entry at gate 1 `[verified]`:

| List | Contents |
|---|---|
| `LCharAnimalForestPrey` 042298 · `MarshPrey` 042296 · `PlainsPrey` 042294 | `LCharElk` + `LCharDeer` |
| `LCharAnimalCanyonPrey` 04229C · `MountainSnowPrey` 0422A2 | `EncGoatWild` (L=1) |
| `LCharAnimalCoastSnowPrey` 0422A4 | `EncHorker` (L=3) |
| `LCharDeer` 0ABEDC · `LCharElk` 0DB2AC · `LCharDeerSprigganCompanion` 0D2071 | L=1 |

#### 4.1.4 The remaining ambient lists

| List | FormKey | **Tier** | **Roster** | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LCharMudcrab` | 02183E | **T1** | Medium ×2 · Large ×2 · Giant ×1 | levels are 1 / 2 / **3** — "Giant" is a size, not a tier |
| `LCharBearPlainsForestHills` | 01E796 | **T3** | Bear ×3 · BearCave ×1 | |
| `LCharSpriggan` | 10EC84 | **T2** | Spriggan ×3 · Matron ×1 | **Dawnguard overrides this record** and adds `DLC1EncSprigganEarthMother` (L=30) at gate 30 `[verified]` — reserve it, per rule 4 |
| `LCharSprigganCompanion` | 01E776 | **T2** | Wolf ×2 · SabreCat ×1 | must track the spriggan that summons it |
| `LCharSprigganCompanionFrost` | 0640BD | **T3** | WolfIce ×2 · SabreCatSnow ×1 | |
| `LCharWitchAny` | 074F9D | **T2** | `LCharWitch01Any` ×3 · `LCharWitch02Any` ×1 | |

#### 4.1.5 Flattening makes the flag question moot

Three lists carry **no `Flags:` block** — `LCharAnimalForest`, `LCharAnimalPlains`,
`LCharAnimalSnowFields`, plus `LCharMudcrab`, `LCharBearPlainsForestHills` `[verified]` — so vanilla
selects only the highest qualifying rung rather than drawing from all of them
(`enemy-taxonomy.md` §1). **Once every entry sits at `Level: 1` the two behaviours coincide**: the
highest qualifying level *is* 1, and every entry is at it. So Ehlnofey does not need to normalise the
flag on any flattened list, and `enemy-taxonomy.md` §1's warning — *"Ehlnofey must not assume the flag
is uniformly set"* — stops applying to this population. It still applies to any list left gated.

**Hard lore constraint, carried:** giants, mammoths and most `PredatorFaction` wildlife are
**passive** and must stay passive (`lore-constraints.md` §4 item 1). Difficulty comes from what they
are, never from making them aggressive. A level-32 giant standing peacefully in a T1 meadow *is* the
design working.

---

## 5. Class C — already fixed, verify and leave

No edit. Listed so the audit script knows they are deliberate. `[verified]`

| Archetype | Level | ≈ Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Skeleton · Deer · Elk · Wolf | 1–2 | T1 |
| Death Hound | 5 | T2 |
| Vigilant of Stendarr | 5 | T2 |
| Ash Spawn | 20 | T4 |
| Giant | 32 | T5 |
| Dragon Priest (all 8 Skyrim, + Vahlok) | 50 | **T7** |

---

## 6. Class D — the `PcLevelMult` actors, including followers

`tiers.md` §7 assigned the world-facing clusters and they are unchanged by the pivot — these actors
never honoured zones anyway (`engine-behaviour.md` §1), so flattening changes nothing about them.

| Cluster | Vanilla | **Ehlnofey** |
|---|---|---|
| City guards | ×1 [20–50] | **21 (T4)** |
| Imperial / Stormcloak soldiers | ×0.25 [1–50] | **14 (T3)** |
| Hunters | ×0.5 [5–15] | **8 (T2)** |
| Nightingales | ×1 [15–45] | **30 (T5)** |
| `WE*` world encounters | various | **8 (T2)** default |
| Zahkriisos | ×1 [25–60] | **60** — matches his fixed siblings |

**Lever:** SkyPatcher `filterByPCLevelMult=true` + `setPcLevelMult=false=<N>` + `level=<N>`. Both
halves or it fails (`implementation-strategy.md` §4).

### 6.1 Followers — deleveled, by role, by hand

Decided in `requiem-method.md` §4.3: Ehlnofey **rejects** Requiem's ally exception. The roster is
Requiem's own retained-68 list (`plugin-analysis.md` §1a), verdict inverted. These are hand-set, not
rule-set — hand-setting is the point.

| Group | **Tier** | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Standard followers — Faendal, Sven, Golldir, Annekke, Benor, Cosnach, Borgakh, Ghorbash, Lob, Ogol, J'zargo, Derkeethus | **T2–T3** (8–14) | Villagers and drifters who agreed to come along |
| Hirelings — Belrand, Jenassa, Marcurio, Stenvar, Vorstag, Erik | **T3** (14) | Working professionals who charge 500 gold |
| Junior Companions — Athis, Njada, Ria, Torvar | **T3** (14) | Whelps |
| Housecarls (incl. Hearthfire) | **T4** (21) | Hold-appointed warriors — **equal to a city guard**, which is exactly what they are |
| Senior Companions — Aela, Farkas, Vilkas | **T5** (30) | Circle members, veterans |
| Dawnguard followers — Agmaer, Beleval, Celann, Durak, Ingjard, Florentius | **T4** (21) | Trained order, mid-campaign |
| Serana | **T6** (40) | Pure-blood Volkihar. Must sit above the generic vampire band (T4) and below Harkon |

**The design consequence, stated so it is chosen and not discovered:** a follower now has a *place* on
the same ladder as the world. A T3 hireling is a real asset to a character clearing T2 bandit camps
and a liability in a T5 barrow. Choosing and changing companions becomes a decision with
consequences — the fixed-world contract applied to allies.

**Flagged as untested** (`requiem-method.md` §8.4): nobody has played this. Revisit after step 9.

---

## 7. Named capstones — above the ladder

From `tiers.md` §8 and `enemy-taxonomy.md` §2.2/§2.5. These are the documented bone-1 exceptions and
the T7-and-above set.

| Record | FormKey | Vanilla | **Ehlnofey** |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AlduinBase` | 08E4F1 | ×1.2 [10–100] | **60** |
| `DLC1Harkon` | 003BA7:Dawnguard | ×1.2 [10–60] | **55** |
| `DLC1HarkonCombat` | 01A93D:Dawnguard | ×1.4 [10–60] | **60** — both records or the transformation is a downgrade |
| `DLC2Miraak` | 017F7D:Dragonborn | ×1 [35–**200**] | **65** |
| `DLC2MiraakMQ06` | 01FB98:Dragonborn | ×1.1 [35–150] | **65** |
| `DLC2AcolyteZahkriisos` | 0248E8:Dragonborn | ×1 [25–60] | **60** — matches his fixed siblings |
| Dragon Priests ×8 + Vahlok | — | fixed 50 | **50 (T7)** — unchanged |
| Ahzidal, Dukaan | 0248E9, 0248E1 | fixed 60 | **60** — unchanged |
| ~~`EncBandit04TemplateMelee`~~ | 01E60D | level 0 | **no record needed** — see below |

Harkon at 55/60 clears his own court (Volkihar 48 / Volkihar Master 53), satisfying
`lore-constraints.md` §3's purity requirement `[verified]`.

### 7.1 The `EncBandit04TemplateMelee` bug is already fixed by Dragonborn.esm

**Found while authoring the record, 2026-07-29.** `[verified]` The L=0 bug is real in
`Skyrim.esm` — the record serializes with no `Level:` line and a vestigial `CalcMinLevel: 14`. But
**`Dragonborn.esm` overrides `01E60D:Skyrim.esm` and re-authors it properly**:

```yaml
  Level:
    MutagenObjectType: NpcLevel
    Level: 14          # <- present only in the Dragonborn override
  CalcMinLevel: 14
```

It also adds `Health: 318`, `Stamina: 152` and four stat values the `Skyrim.esm` record lacks. Since
Ehlnofey masters `Dragonborn.esm`, the winning record already carries the fix, and an Ehlnofey
override would be a pure ITM.

**This is CLAUDE.md's own last-wins gotcha catching a Phase 1 analysis that read the wrong file.**
The claim originates in `enemy-taxonomy.md` §1 (*"Reading the `L=0` entries"*), which read
`reference/Base/01Skyrim/`. Four documents repeat it and need correcting: `enemy-taxonomy.md` §1
and §8, `tiers.md` §10, `CLAUDE.md`'s *Useful FormKey constants* table, and
`implementation-strategy.md` §2.4.

**Caveat worth keeping:** the fix is Dragonborn's, so it holds *only because* Ehlnofey requires
Dragonborn. Anyone lifting this design onto a Skyrim-only plugin must re-add the override.

---

## 8. What this hands to the build

| | count |
|---|---|
| Class A lists to flatten (§3) | **~40** |
| Class B substitution lists (§4) | **9** |
| Class B biome + ambient lists (§4.1.2, §4.1.4) | **19** |
| Class B prey lists — **already flat, 0 edits** (§4.1.3) | 9 |
| Class C — verify only | 8 families, **0 edits** |
| Class D — SkyPatcher rules (§6) | **~6 lines** |
| Followers — hand-set `NPC_` overrides (§6.1) | **~68** |
| Named capstones (§7) | **8 records** |

**~68 leveled lists and ~76 NPC records** for the entire actor half — against `requiem-method.md`
§5.5's ~450 for the loot half. The actors were never the expensive part; `enemy-taxonomy.md` §6 said
so in Phase 1 (*"the dominant cost is E, not the actors at all"*) and the pivot has not changed it.

---

## 9. Open questions

1. ~~The draugr band (T1–T5) is the widest in the table and the least defended.~~ **RESOLVED
   2026-07-29 — narrowed to T2–T4**, Deathlords pushed to boss placements (§3.2). Two residual
   decisions are recorded there: whether the plain Draugr (L=1) keeps a home on the Missile list, and
   whether Bleak Falls Barrow survives a raised floor at main-quest level.

1a. **Rule 3 is violated by nine other rows, and narrowing draugr exposed it.** §1 rule 3 says a
   roster spans *"at most three adjacent tiers"*. These span four: Forsworn rank-and-file (T1–T4) and
   boss (T3–T6), Warlock (T2–T5), Vampire (T2–T5), Falmer melee (T2–T5), Dremora (T2–T5), Dragon
   (T3–T6), Gargoyle (T3–T6), Draugr boss (T3–T6). Either the rule relaxes to four, or those nine
   narrow the way draugr just did. **Not decided here** — it is one choice applied nine times, and it
   should be made deliberately rather than folded into an unrelated edit.
2. **Bandits become trivial after ~T3, and they are ~40% of the placed world.** That is the honest
   cost of a fixed world and Requiem accepts it. The alternative — widening the bandit band — trades
   legibility for relevance. Do not decide this on paper; decide it after walking into three camps.
3. **Weights are guesses.** The rungs are `[verified]`; the ×3/×2/×1 ratios are design judgement with
   no vanilla precedent to copy, because vanilla never needed weights. Expect to retune.
4. **Follower tiers are untested as a design** (§6.1).
5. ~~Ambient biome rosters are sketched, not enumerated.~~ **CLOSED** — §4.1 now carries all 19 lists
   from `reference/`, and the exercise found the density-ramp trap (§4.1.1) that a sketch would have
   walked straight into. The biome *tier assignments* in §4.1.2 remain design judgement; the rosters
   themselves are vanilla's, filtered.
6. **`LCharAnimalSnowFields`, `…Forest` and `…Plains` are the three lists whose frozen rosters were
   hand-built rather than filtered**, because with no flags and one entry per gate there is no
   "eligible mix" to freeze. They are small (3–6 entries) but they are the only invented rows in §4.1.
